```bash
git clone 
cd genius-ai-assistant
```

### 🐍 2. Set up Python Environment
Make sure you have **Python 3.9+** installed.
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate   # ✅ On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # ✅ On Windows
```

### 📦 3. Install Dependencies
Install all required libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Example `requirements.txt`:**
```
Flask
flask-cors
SpeechRecognition
openai
langdetect
pyaudio
```

> 💡 **Note:** For `pyaudio`, install system-level packages if needed:  
> • **macOS:** `brew install portaudio`  
> • **Windows:** `pip install pipwin && pipwin install pyaudio`  
> • **Linux:** `sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev`

### 🔑 4. Configure API Key
Create a `config.py` file in the project root with:
```python
OPENROUTER_API_KEY = "your_openrouter_api_key_here"
```
👉 Get your API key from [https://openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai).

### ▶️ 5. Run the Server
```bash
python server.py
```

🌐 The Flask server will start at:  
```
http://localhost:5001
 
## 📡 API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/health` | GET | Health check |
| `/api/listen` | POST | Captures microphone input, processes voice, and returns AI response |
| `/api/chat` | POST | Accepts JSON `{ "text": "your query" }` and returns AI response |

**Example with `curl`:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/chat \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"text": "who made you"}'
```

## 🛠️ Adding New Features

- Add more **predefined responses** inside `predefined_responses()` in `server.py`.
- Add new app launchers in the `apps` dictionary inside `open_application()`.
- Integrate reminders or IPL APIs within `handle_query()`.
